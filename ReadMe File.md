# Melanoma Detection Assignment
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- In this assignment, you will build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 
- This project is build with using the CNN models by image preprocessing

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The model is able to predict well by using multiple layers of Convolution 2D (Upto 256)
- The model can be further improved by adding more images.
- The training accuracy has improved with a value of 0.8398 whereas validation accuracy is now 0.8248
- The training loss is reduced to 0.4190 and validation loss is reduced to 0.4448.
- The model can be further improved by adding more images and by performing with some more epochs in final model.
